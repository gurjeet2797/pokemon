Shared Dependencies:

1. CSS Styles: All HTML files will share the "styles.css" file for consistent styling across the website. This includes the Tailwind CSS classes for a dark, clean, and simple design.

2. Assets: The "assets/logo.png" and "assets/background.jpg" will be shared across multiple HTML files for branding and design consistency.

3. Slide Structure: Each slide HTML file will share a similar structure, including a title and content section. This structure can be defined in a shared HTML template.

4. DOM Element IDs: Each slide will likely have unique IDs for the title and content sections for potential JavaScript manipulation. These could be "slide-title" and "slide-content".

5. Slide Data: The title and content for each slide will be shared data that could be stored in a shared JSON file or JavaScript object.

6. Navigation: There may be shared navigation elements or functions across the slides, such as "next-slide" and "previous-slide".

7. Shared Functions: If there are any interactive elements or animations, the JavaScript functions controlling these may be shared across multiple files. These could include functions like "transitionSlide()" or "animateContent()".

8. Shared Meta Tags: All HTML files will share similar meta tags for SEO and website configuration. These could include the viewport, description, and author meta tags.

9. Shared HTML Elements: Common HTML elements like headers, footers, and navigation bars will be shared across all HTML files.
